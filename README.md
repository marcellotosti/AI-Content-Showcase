# 🌐 AI Content Showcase

Welcome! This is my public portfolio as I transition into **AI Content & UX**.  
Here, I’ll document projects from my personal 6-week skill-building program — combining my background in digital marketing with new skills in **Prompt Engineering, Conversational Design, and AI Content Strategy**.

## 📂 Project Areas

- **Prompts** → A growing library of effective prompts with real examples and outputs.  
- **Case Studies** → Write-ups showing how I applied AI to real-world projects and workflows.  
- **Chatbot Demo** → Simple, shareable chatbot experiments that highlight conversational UX design.

## 🚀 Goals

This repository will:  
1. Track my weekly progress as I build AI-focused skills.  
2. Showcase applied projects that recruiters and hiring managers can explore.  
3. Complement my marketing portfolio by showing how I’m evolving into AI-driven content and UX.
